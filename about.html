	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm Johnny Packard and this is my baking blog! Each week I try out a new recipe and post it here to share it with the world. If you enjoy any of the recipes I post feel free to leave a comment.</p>

	<p>I grew up in Central Minnesota and got the baking bug from my mother and grandmother when I was a young child. My grandmother used to bake daily for afternoon Fika, think English Tea Time, but with Swedish flair and coffee, lots and lots of coffee.</p>
